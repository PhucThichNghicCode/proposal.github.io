# APEX-EV Electric Vehicle Service Platform 

### 1. Executive Summary
RenGen is a comprehensive management platform designed to digitize and optimize maintenance workflows at service centers. The system centrally manages the entire service lifecycle—from request intake and repair processing to customer care—helping to eliminate manual tasks and enhance efficiency. Leveraging the power of the AWS cloud, RenGen combines flexible container architecture on Amazon ECS Fargate with the intelligent processing capabilities of Generative AI through Amazon Bedrock. The solution integrates automated development processes (CI/CD) from GitLab, ensuring rapid deployment speeds, high security, and rigorous monitoring, delivering a superior experience for end-users.

### 2. Problem Statement
### What’s the Problem?
Current operational processes rely heavily on manual methods, leading to inefficiencies, fragmented data, and a lack of intelligent support tools for automated customer interaction.

### The Solution
The platform employs a modern architecture, starting at the Edge layer with Amazon Route 53 for user routing. The interface (Frontend) is hosted on AWS Amplify Hosting, ensuring fast and stable access.
Amazon API Gateway acts as the central hub, intelligently routing requests.

To ensure security, critical components such as ECS Fargate and the Amazon RDS database are placed in a Private Subnet, completely isolated from the public internet. Image data is stored on Amazon S3 and accessed securely via S3 Endpoints. Additionally, the software development process is fully automated: source code from GitLab is packaged and pushed to Amazon ECR for deployment to ECS.

### Benefits and Return on Investment
Adopting this architecture delivers a significant competitive advantage by integrating Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) via Amazon Bedrock, which helps automate customer care and data analysis. The system ensures high availability and data security thanks to the VPC network separation design (Public/Private subnets).

The CI/CD process integrated with GitLab and ECR helps minimize downtime when updating new features, while Amazon CloudWatch provides comprehensive monitoring to detect incidents instantly. The cost model is optimized thanks to the use of Fargate (Serverless container) and Lambda (Pay-per-use), ensuring businesses only pay for the actual resources used. This investment not only resolves current operational challenges but also creates a solid technological foundation for long-term growth, with the expected Return on Investment (ROI) period significantly shortened.

### 3. Solution Architecture
The RenGen management platform applies a modern architecture on AWS, beginning with user access via Amazon Route 53 at the Edge layer. The User Interface (Frontend) is hosted and deployed through AWS Amplify Hosting, connecting directly to Amazon API Gateway, which serves as the central communication portal. Here, data flow is flexibly divided: intelligent tasks and notifications are handled by a Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda connected to Amazon Bedrock (for AI features) and AWS SES (for email services). Core business logic is routed through an Application Load Balancer (ALB) located in the Public Subnet, then forwarded to the application running on Amazon ECS Fargate, which is securely protected within a Private Subnet. The system stores relational data on Amazon RDS and manages image files via Amazon S3 (securely connected via S3 Endpoints). Furthermore, the development process is automated via CI/CD from GitLab pushing container images to Amazon ECR, along with Amazon CloudWatch ensuring comprehensive monitoring.The RenGen management platform applies a modern architecture on AWS, beginning with user access via Amazon Route 53 at the Edge layer.

### AWS Services Used
- *Route 53*: DNS service, responsible for routing the domain (Edge layer) to the application. 
- *AWS Amplify Hosting*: Hosts the web interface (frontend) and can integrate with CDN/WAF. In the diagram, it receives traffic from Route 53.
- *Amazon API Gateway*: The main entry point (Gateway), receiving and routing all requests from the frontend/Amplify to processing services.  
- *AWS Lambda (Bedrock)*: Handles AI/Generative AI tasks (prediction/content generation) by communicating with Amazon Bedrock.
- *AWS Lambda (SES)*: Handles asynchronous tasks, such as processing notifications to send emails via AWS SES.
- *Amazon Bedrock*: General AI service (Gen AI), providing foundation models to execute intelligent business operations.
- *AWS SES*: Email sending service, performs the sending of notifications, quotes, or processing results from Lambda.
- *VPC*: Virtual network environment containing and protecting AWS resources (like ALB, ECS Fargate, RDS).
- *ALB (Application Load Balancer)*: Load balancer, distributing traffic from API Gateway to application containers running on ECS Fargate.
- *Amazon ECS Fargate*: Runs the backend application as containers without server management, handling core business logic.
- *Amazon RDS*: Provides a relational database, placed in a Private Subnet to store structured data.
- *Amazon S3*: Stores multimedia files like photos or other large data.
- *ECR*: Repository for application container images (Docker), used by ECS Fargate for deployment.
- *AWS CloudWatch*: Monitoring service, collecting logs and metrics from the entire system to track performance and detect issues.

### Component Design
- *Request Handling*: Route 53 routes the domain name to AWS Amplify Hosting, where the web interface is hosted. Requests from the web interface are then forwarded to Amazon API Gateway, the entry point acting to receive and route all traffic.  
- *Business Logic Processing*:
    + *Core Logic*: All core business logic is handled by applications running on Amazon ECS Fargate, placed within a private network (Private Subnet) to ensure security.
    + *AI/Asynchronous Tasks*: Generative or AI tasks are processed by AWS Lambda (Bedrock) via Amazon Bedrock. Auxiliary tasks like email sending are handled by AWS Lambda (SES) and executed by AWS SES.
- *Network Infrastructure*:
    + *Public Subnet*: Contains services needing Internet exposure, such as the ALB.
    + *Private Subnet*: Contains sensitive resources like ECS Fargate and Amazon RDS, protecting them from direct external access.
- *Data Storage*: Sensitive and structured data is stored on Amazon RDS. Multimedia files or other large data sets are stored on Amazon S3
- *Deployment and Monitoring*: The container deployment process is managed via GitLab and AWS ECR (container image repository). CloudWatch performs overall monitoring of performance, logs, and metrics for all services from ECS, Lambda, to RDS.

### 4. Technical Implementation
**Implementation Phases**
The development project for the RenGen Smart Electric Vehicle Maintenance Platform — including the integration of an AI virtual assistant and a service management system — undergoes 4 phases:
1. *Research and Architectural Design*: Research suitable technologies (React.js, Spring Boot, AWS Bedrock) and design a system architecture combining Containers (ECS) and Serverless (Lambda) on AWS (1 month prior to commencement).
2. *Cost Estimation and Feasibility Check*: Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate operating costs for core services such as ECS Fargate, RDS, and token costs for Amazon Bedrock, and propose the most feasible solution.
3. *Architecture Adjustment for Cost/Solution Optimization*: Refine the architecture, select appropriate configurations for ECS Fargate and RDS, and optimize Lambda runtime (timeouts) to balance AI processing performance and cost.
4. *Development, Testing, and Deployment*: Program the React.js application (Frontend) and Spring Boot (Backend), integrate the Bedrock Agent, deploy CI/CD pipelines via GitLab, package Docker images to ECR, and launch operations on ECS. Technical Requirements
*Technical Requirements*  
- *User Interface (Frontend)*: Practical knowledge of React.js to build scheduling interfaces and chat with the AI virtual assistant. Use AWS Amplify to automate the deployment process (Hosting), connect with Amazon API Gateway to send secure processing requests, ensuring a smooth user experience on all devices.
- *Core System (Backend & Infrastructure)*: In-depth knowledge of Java/Spring Boot to develop maintenance business logic. The application is packaged using Docker, with images stored on AWS ECR and running on Amazon ECS Fargate. Requires understanding of Amazon RDS for relational databases (storing vehicle profiles, maintenance history). Specifically, requires AWS Lambda (Python) programming skills to connect with Amazon Bedrock (AI/Chatbot processing) and AWS SES (sending asynchronous email notifications). Manage detailed user authentication and authorization (customers/technicians) via Amazon Cognito.
